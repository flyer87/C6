- RESTS:		
	- The rest of the tests for views 
	- Stack and Queues - do and write it in "Implementation of data structure" (1)
	- in Unit test I mentioned that I check for toArray() or whatever ??? (1)	
	- Assert.Multiple() (1)	
	- version question, Peter
	- SCG.IEnumerable<T> items -> call .toArray() in the beginning of the method;
		- catch eventual bad enumerator somehow -> 
			IExtensible.Requires(ForAll(items, item => true), ItemsMustBeNonNull);
	- LL.ClearPrivate()
		- UpdateVersion() - naeaeaeh. Move it up ?!
	- All data structures
		- RaiseForClear -> RaiseForRemoveIndexRange
	- Code Contracts 
		- only in the private methods ???
		- look at private methods and try to add pre-conditions			
			- additional postconditions: look at Mikkel's implementations.				
		- C. contracts warned me for what?
		- HLL: tag invarinats
		"offers guarantees regarding the state of an object"	
		
	- Tests:
		- iExtensible for HAL, HLL: Ensures(AllowsDuplicates ? Result<bool>() : OldValue(!this.Contains(item, EqualityComparer)));		
		- failing volatile tests
		- Implement the test for the remaining methods for views
		- fluctuating tests still	
		
	
- Al+HAL in array; LL + HLL in linkedlists???	
- try to get how the tag staff in the views work	

================================================	
//- look at the test patterns of C6
//- look at the C5's view tests
- write tests for the views (of ArrayList; HashedArrayList; LinkedList; HashedLinkedList)
	- test refernce list tests for
		Peter's tests // View, ViewOf, LastViewOf, TrySlide x2, Slide x2	
			Test case 1/9 using
			View
			ViewOf
			LastViewOf			
			Slide1, Slide2, 
			TrySlide1, TrySlide2
	//- Span - implement tests
	
	
	
- read for Test Driven ??? TDD - links
- implement some missing tests in C6
	_ReadOnlyCollection_
	_FixedSizeCollection_	
		Added: public void ShuffleRandom_IsFixedSizedCollection_ThrowsNothing()
	//_DuplicatesByCounting_ - will not be considered
	_Set_ what is that ???
