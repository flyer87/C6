- RESTS:
	- Code Contracts - only in the private methods ???
		- look at private methods and try to add pre-conditions			
		additional postconditions: look at Mikkel's implementations.
		- Properties: no Code Contracts for set {}
	- documentation
	- Tests:
		- failing IsValid tests
		- failing Violate tests
	- RaiseFor - only those that are not already in the list
- try to get how the tag staff in the views work	

================================================		
- invalidate
	
- fix: Insert and this[] - they shoudl either throw an exception or require a precondition.


//- look at the test patterns of C6
//- look at the C5's view tests
- write tests for the views (of ArrayList; HashedArrayList; LinkedList; HashedLinkedList)
	- test refernce list tests for
		Peter's tests // View, ViewOf, LastViewOf, TrySlide x2, Slide x2	
			Test case 1/9 using
			View
			ViewOf
			LastViewOf			
			Slide1, Slide2, 
			TrySlide1, TrySlide2
	//- Span - implement tests
	
	

- edit the failing tests
	- fluctuating tests still ???
- read for Test Driven ??? TDD - links
- implement some missing tests in C6
	_ReadOnlyCollection_
	_FixedSizeCollection_	
		Added: public void ShuffleRandom_IsFixedSizedCollection_ThrowsNothing()
	//_DuplicatesByCounting_ - will not be considered
	_Set_ what is that ???		
- IsValid tests	
=================
- Code Contracts for private methods - look and do it the same way for the rest.
	Code contracts warnmed me for that ???
