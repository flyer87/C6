- try to get how the tag staff in the views work	
	
- Double, triplle check C6.ArrayList with the view extensions I did.
	//- remove RequierValidity
		//- put isValid
	//- fixViews... - on their places
		Where: look C5
	//- Offset+, where:
		index, i, count
		// GetHashCode never used ?
				
	//- implement private void Dipose()
	//- run the tests
	- private indexOf, lastIndexOf
	============
	- invalidate
	
- fix: Insert and this[] - they shoudl either throw an exception or require a precondition.

- look at the test patterns of C6
- look at the C5's view tests
- write tests for the views
	- ArrayList
		- implement Span
	- HashedArrayList
	- LinkedList
	- HashedLinkedList
- implemnt some missing tests
	those with suffix _fail, ...
- collect the "???" from the .cs files
=================
- Code Contracts for private methods - look and do it the same way for the rest.
