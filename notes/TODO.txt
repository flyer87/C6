- RESTS:	
	//- documentation - fix the small issues.
	- The rest of the tests for views (1)
	//- C6 -> C6 Cont
	- ??? Stack and Queues - do and write it in "Implementation of data structure"
	- in Unit test I mentioned that I check for toArray() or whatever ??? (1)
	- version question, Peter
	- Assert.Multiple() (1)		
	- Code Contracts 
		- only in the private methods ???
		- look at private methods and try to add pre-conditions			
			- additional postconditions: look at Mikkel's implementations.				
		- C. contracts warned me for what?
		- HLL: tag invarinats
		"offers guarantees regarding the state of an object"	
	- Tests
		- iExtensible for HAL, HLL: Ensures(AllowsDuplicates ? Result<bool>() : OldValue(!this.Contains(item, EqualityComparer)));
		- failing IsValid tests
		- failing volatile tests
		- Implement the test for the remaining methods for views
		- fluctuating tests still	
		
	
- Al+HAL in array; LL + HLL in linkedlists???	
- try to get how the tag staff in the views work	

================================================	
//- look at the test patterns of C6
//- look at the C5's view tests
- write tests for the views (of ArrayList; HashedArrayList; LinkedList; HashedLinkedList)
	- test refernce list tests for
		Peter's tests // View, ViewOf, LastViewOf, TrySlide x2, Slide x2	
			Test case 1/9 using
			View
			ViewOf
			LastViewOf			
			Slide1, Slide2, 
			TrySlide1, TrySlide2
	//- Span - implement tests
	
	
	
- read for Test Driven ??? TDD - links
- implement some missing tests in C6
	_ReadOnlyCollection_
	_FixedSizeCollection_	
		Added: public void ShuffleRandom_IsFixedSizedCollection_ThrowsNothing()
	//_DuplicatesByCounting_ - will not be considered
	_Set_ what is that ???
