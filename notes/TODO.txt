- RESTS:		
	- Queue tests
	- 8 methods		
	- Introduction
	- Abstract
	- Conclussion	
	====
	- The strcuture of the report is influenced by C6
	- The rest of the tests for views (!!!!!)		
		- Queue tests
		- view tests - only updating ones	
		- Stack: Run.If() - needed
	- HLL.Add() misses Ensure. It also should check that the result is true.
	- SCG.IEnumerable<T> items -> call .toArray() in the beginning of the method;
		- catch eventual bad enumerator somehow -> 
			IExtensible.Requires(ForAll(items, item => true), ItemsMustBeNonNull);		
	- All data structures - fix it (1)
		- RaiseForClear -> RaiseForRemoveIndexRange		
	- Usage examples
	- in Unit test I mentioned that I check for toArray() or whatever ??? (1)	
	- Assert.Multiple() (1)	
	- Stack and Queues - do and write it in "Implementation of data structure" (1)
	- Run.If:
		- public void ItemGet_RandomCollectionWithNull_Null()
	- version question, Peter	
	- LL.ClearPrivate()
		- UpdateVersion() - naeaeaeh. Move it up ?!
	- Code Contracts 
		- only in the private methods ???
		- look at private methods and try to add pre-conditions			
			- additional postconditions: look at Mikkel's implementations.				
		- C. contracts warned me for what?
			Before tests to fail Code Contracts failed (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
				- View enumerator.Skip.take and bam!
				- HAL... => [Offset]; it was HAL... =>[0]
				- There were cases when the Code Contracts passed, but the test failed. This is the case with view, where there are many aspects to check and missed some of them.
		- HLL: tag invarinats
		"offers guarantees regarding the state of an object"	
		
	- Tests:
		- iExtensible for HAL, HLL: Ensures(AllowsDuplicates ? Result<bool>() : OldValue(!this.Contains(item, EqualityComparer)));		
		- failing violate tests
		- Implement the test for the remaining methods for views
		- fluctuating tests still	
		
	
- Al+HAL in array; LL + HLL in linkedlists???	
- try to get how the tag staff in the views work	

================================================	
//- look at the test patterns of C6
//- look at the C5's view tests
- write tests for the views (of ArrayList; HashedArrayList; LinkedList; HashedLinkedList)
	- test refernce list tests for
		Peter's tests // View, ViewOf, LastViewOf, TrySlide x2, Slide x2	
			Test case 1/9 using
			View
			ViewOf
			LastViewOf			
			Slide1, Slide2, 
			TrySlide1, TrySlide2
	//- Span - implement tests
	
	
	
- read for Test Driven ??? TDD - links
- implement some missing tests in C6
	_ReadOnlyCollection_
	_FixedSizeCollection_	
		Added: public void ShuffleRandom_IsFixedSizedCollection_ThrowsNothing()
	//_DuplicatesByCounting_ - will not be considered
	_Set_ what is that ???
