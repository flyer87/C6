- RESTS:			
	- Introduction
	- Abstract
	- Conclussion	
	====
	Prioritized:		
		- SCG.IEnumerable<T> items -> call .toArray() in the beginning of the method;
			- catch eventual bad enumerator somehow -> 
				IExtensible.Requires(ForAll(items, item => true), ItemsMustBeNonNull);
		- ToArray() in view methods; written in the report
		- _version ++				
		- fluctuating tests still				
			
		- documentation
		//- AddRange()
		//- RemoveAt_violatesPrecondtions - failed
			IList.RemoveAt(int), normally no preconditions allowed, but it is new in IList
			Added the preconditions, it worked.
		// User examples
	
	====
	- The strcuture of the report is influenced by C6
	- The rest of the tests for views (!!!!!)				
		- view tests - only updating ones	
		- Stack: Run.If() - needed		
	- Assert.Multiple() (1)	
	- Stack and Queues - do and write it in "Implementation of data structure" (1)
	- Run.If:
		- public void ItemGet_RandomCollectionWithNull_Null()
	- version question, Peter	
	- LL.ClearPrivate()
		- UpdateVersion() - naeaeaeh. Move it up ?!
	- Code Contracts 
		- only in the private methods ???
		- look at private methods and try to add pre-conditions			
			- additional postconditions: look at Mikkel's implementations.				
		- C. contracts warned me for what?
			Before tests to fail Code Contracts failed (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
				- View enumerator.Skip.take and bam!
				- HAL... => [Offset]; it was HAL... =>[0]
				- There were cases when the Code Contracts passed, but the test failed. This is the case with view, where there are many aspects to check and missed some of them.
		- HLL: tag invarinats
		"offers guarantees regarding the state of an object"	
		
	- Tests:
		- iExtensible for HAL, HLL: Ensures(AllowsDuplicates ? Result<bool>() : OldValue(!this.Contains(item, EqualityComparer)));								
		
	
- Al+HAL in array; LL + HLL in linkedlists???	
- try to get how the tag staff in the views work	

================================================	
//- look at the test patterns of C6
//- look at the C5's view tests
- write tests for the views (of ArrayList; HashedArrayList; LinkedList; HashedLinkedList)
	- test refernce list tests for
		Peter's tests // View, ViewOf, LastViewOf, TrySlide x2, Slide x2	
			Test case 1/9 using
			View
			ViewOf
			LastViewOf			
			Slide1, Slide2, 
			TrySlide1, TrySlide2
	//- Span - implement tests
	
	
	
- read for Test Driven ??? TDD - links
- implement some missing tests in C6
	_ReadOnlyCollection_
	_FixedSizeCollection_	
		Added: public void ShuffleRandom_IsFixedSizedCollection_ThrowsNothing()
	//_DuplicatesByCounting_ - will not be considered
	_Set_ what is that ???
