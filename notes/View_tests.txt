Quest:
	- C6: "It can sometimes be necessary to delay execution, for instance when testing preconditions (section 5.4.1.1) or events (section 5.4.2.1), in which case the act is inlined using a delegate"
	- C6."Each test has its own random number generator accessible with TestContext.CurrentContext.Random"
		- FsCheck ???
	- C5.Check() -> into Invariants
		??? MSDN."You must use the binary rewriter for run-time enforcement of this invariant."			
		!!! heavy checks
	- Scenarious:	
		- Reverse() 0-item, 1-item, N-item view, check the list. Do it for all M methods ???			
	- What is #if DEBUG directive?
=======
TODO:	
	//- C5.Check() -> into Invariants
	- Raises expected events
	- slow MS Studio					
	- Read about the contribution of Code Contracts to the Testing

Test Reference List for views:
	" Most of the unit tests on the test reference list (section 5.3.1) were coded as a Live Templates."
	ViewOf existing, non-exisitng item

Thesis notes:
	- public static string GetUppercaseString(Randomizer random) => random.GetString(25, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"); - missing "I"
	- public void TrySlide_NotAView_ViolatesPrecondition()
		Assert.That(() => collection.TrySlide(index), Violates.Precondition);
			??? Requires(Underlying != null, NotAView); 
			
	- Mikkel: was Last_RandomCollectionStartingWithNull_Null, but should by ...EndingWith...
	- public void RemoveAt_RandomCollection_ItemAtIndex()
		used: var expectedItem = collection[index];
		better: var expectedItem = collection.ElementAt()
	- private sealed class WeakViewList<V> : SCG.IEnumerable<V> where V : class. It was not implementing the IEnum... interface which was a problem for ForAll() in the invariants
	- LL.Invariant(ForAll(_underlying._views, v => { ... })) includes many conditions. Otherwise it would be heavy
