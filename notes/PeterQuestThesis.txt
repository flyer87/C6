view slideing affects underlying stamp
	insert -> both viwe, views and underlying
	view.slide -> only the view
//report - deadline - 14,15.12
======================
// 27.10
- Multiples View test in C5
	Test strategy - corner cases, effect on the other views	
	Something about the Random collections, duplications, using SetUp method ...
- enumeratorstamp = underlying != null ? underlying.stamp : this.stamp
	yessss
=========================
11.10
//LinkedList: (underlying ?? this).raiseForSetThis(index, value, item);
	index, not offset + index
//LinkedList:  CircularQueue -> SCG.Queue; a new instance
- Insert, [index] := item; in HashedLL: throw and expetion or just return from the method;
	- keep it like that, throw an exception

//- C5.void InsertAll(int i, SCG.IEnumerable<T> items, bool insertion) - 
	//- if (!dict.FindOrAdd(item, ref tmp)) - does it update the key ?
- Remove(...), 119 - why 119?
	- it is not used at all.
C5.void splittaggroup(TagGroup taggroup)
	- taggroup1.tags U taggroup2.tags = {1,2,3} Can we have same number in the low level ???
		- find it!
=======================
27.09
- properties should have IsValid or not ? 
	According to framework design - no exceptions can be thrown
	Mikkel has, though.
- Re-use the same code?	
		- linkedlist sorting
			- reuse; chainge if code contracts require that.		
- VS slow building. Any suggestions?

==========================
19.09
UniqueItems() - 
	public virtual ICollectionValue<T> UniqueItems()
		return this; // it has stamp checking => fine
Slide returns the same view after sliding. Do we need it to return "this"
	chaining; xs.
	Effective Java, Bloch, second edition!!!
		changing + side effect ?!
Code and notes - fine, do it.

=======================
- Can I be able to finish all?
	- HashArrayList requires Hashset to be implemented. use it from .Net
	- HashLinkedList requires HashDictionary. Rearrange IDictionary hierarchy ? use it from .Net

- "Re-write" the code (new design: C# 6.0 + Framework) + Code C. + Test U.
- Suggestion: 
		AL + V - fix;
		HAL + V
		LL + V
		(probably)HLL % V
================
Old:
- LinkedList
	design goals?
	
		- C6
		- re-build, re-structure
		- implement views?
		- adopt the Mikkel's code (classes and interfaces), if I think the code is good.
		The goals is to extend the work on ArrayList
