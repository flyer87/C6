IList.cs // Code Contracts section
	Why do we have extra Add here for SCG.ICollection and SCG.IList ?
        #region SCG.ICollection<T>

        void SCG.ICollection<T>.Add(T item) {}
        void SCG.IList<T>.Insert(int index, T item) {}

        #endregion
		
Invarinats, user guide:
	- "Invariants are conditionally defined on the full-contract symbol. " ???
	- ! "Automatic properties are getters and setters without an explicit implementation. Due to the lack of a code body, it isnâ€™t possible to write Requires or Ensures directly on such auto-properties. Instead, we use invariants on auto-properties to indirectly write such pre- and postconditions on the setters and getters of auto-properties."
