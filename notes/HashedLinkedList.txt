- invariants in C5
- RaiseForAddRange(array) - not correct
	- some of array items can't bo added, since they're already there. Should raise only for the added ones.

===========
Thesis notes:
	- void C5.AddNode() => bool C6.AddNode()
	- object initializer used in:
		private  void SplitTagGroupPrivate(TagGroup taggroup) {
			...
			var newtaggroup = new TagGroup { ... }
		}
